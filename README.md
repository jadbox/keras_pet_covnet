# keras_pet_covnet

This is a simple training and validation project to test against classifying cats and dogs via this [tutorial](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html). Training images can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).

The Dockerfile is prebuilt as [jadbox/keras-cpu-ipy](https://hub.docker.com/r/jadbox/keras-cpu-ipy/) for running Keras in CPU mode which will allow VirtualBox to execute these Keras projects.
